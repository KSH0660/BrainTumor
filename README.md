At this google drive directory, there are not only our model weight but also tempurature normal brain slices for a single subject.


We stronly recomment to explore our jupyter notebook file (./inference_example.ipynb)! 
Step-by-step procedures are well-expressed.

If you want to use it for data augmentation, I recommend you to modify the jupyter notebook file. 

Below are interesting slices for each step. 
Have fun!

__Generation of Binary Tumor Mask__

The binary tumor masks are generated by following figure.

There are 4 different cases of video for generation of the binary tumor masks.

The 1st column and the 2nd column are the input and output images.

__Generation of Grade Tumor Mask__

The grade tumor masks are generated by following figure.

__Synthesis of Brain Tumor MR Images__

The brain tumor images are synthesized by following figure.

The 1st column represents various concentric circles, and the images of 2nd column are the grade tumor mask generated by the concentric circles of 1st column.
The images of the 3rd to 6th column are brain tumor MR images which are taken by imaging squence of FLAIR, T1w, T1c, T2w
